# Consumer-Binding Evidence

Use this record to interpret compatibility claims. It preserves exact physical modes, consumer versions, observed results, and missing evidence. For choosing a mode, return to [compatibility](../user/compatibility.md).

## Recorded Fallback And Consumer Limits

- GameSir G7 Pro `3537:100A` and `3537:1022` are input-only. OJD does not
  switch modes or force re-enumeration; hold the controller's physical
  Menu+Share combination before connecting to expose a configuration-ready
  identity and its additional features.
- GameSir's shared Microsoft Bluetooth identities `045E:02FD` and `045E:02FF`
  remain on Microsoft or Generic HID handling. OJD does not assign them a
  GameSir model without an exact hardware capture.
- GameSir `3537:1004` remains the Linux-backed XUSB identity shared with T4
  Kaleid; the reported White G7 Pro dongle collision is not enough to change
  that route. Linux-backed `3537:100F` and `3537:1010` also retain their XUSB
  and GIP paths.
- Generic HID maps descriptor-defined controls but cannot infer vendor protocols.
- Raw and vendor-specific USB controllers use direct IOUSBHost when macOS permits app ownership.
  Entitlement-restricted models require OJD's signed USB DriverKit extension.
- Automatic GIP and the explicit `apple-gamecontroller` route publish Xbox Series
  `045E:0B13` "Xbox Wireless Controller". GameController.framework bound that
  identity on GameSir G7 SE USB GIP. A custom SDL 3.4.16 HIDAPI+IOKit build
  (no GameController.framework) bound the same identity as HIDAPI xboxone over
  Bluetooth (`bus_type` 2) and took the 17-byte BLE path, not USB GIP.
  Interrupt IN streams idle 17-byte Series reports (`0x01` plus 0x8000
  sticks, official BLE rest). HIDAPI xboxone BLE `HandleStatePacket` maps
  those to signed 0 (`raw - 0x8000`) before jitter. A 12s interrupt watch
  saw 48 idle reports and no physical button bit. A packer-built A-pressed
  17-byte Series report decodes SOUTH true through the same BLE layout; that
  is not a physical press. Steam `hid_init` still hangs (Steam bundled SDL
  3.5.0, 5s watchdog). sdlHIDAPI remains source-backed; this is not a Steam
  HIDAPI result. Explicit picker DualShock 4 `054C:09CC` "Wireless Controller"
  (USB, 64-byte report `0x01`, descriptor 114 bytes) and DualSense `054C:0CE6`
  "Wireless Controller" (USB, 64-byte report `0x01`, descriptor 273 bytes)
  both returned `GCController.supportsHIDDevice` yes and custom SDL HIDAPI
  `SDL_OpenGamepad` as ps4/ps5. Explicit Switch Pro `057E:2009` "Pro Controller"
  (USB Joystick, 64-byte reports, descriptor 203 bytes) returned
  `supportsHIDDevice` yes without hang and custom HIDAPI `SDL_OpenGamepad` as
  switchpro. Explicit `sdl2-3` `045E:028E` "Xbox 360 Wired Controller" (USB
  Joystick, 14-byte reports, `bcdDevice` 0x0114, descriptor 201 bytes)
  returned `supportsHIDDevice` yes and custom HIDAPI `SDL_OpenGamepad` as
  xbox360. Ignore leftover IOHID `045E:028E` `AppleGCSyntheticDevice`
  "GamePad-1" when it is not the OJD user-space device: GameController
  creates that 360 HID shim when it binds an Xbox identity (`045E:0B13`
  included). OJD excludes synthetic registry markers before any user-client
  open; the product name `GamePad-1` alone does not exclude a physical device. Stock SDL match-all
  still deadlocks on a leftover wedged shim. Physical GIP on this
  GameSir G7 SE completes Hello (`0x02`) plus one rest input (`0x20`, 36-byte
  Share report, all-zero payload). Further `0x20` frames follow the GIP
  change-only rule, so a later packet-log window of 8-byte status (`0x03`)
  keepalives is not a failed handshake; the 48-entry log ages out that rest
  `0x20`. A 20s `controller trace` with no physical press saw only status.
  Steam `hid_init` still hangs. Automatic GIP was restored to Series.
- Blink, WebKit, and unknown Automatic consumers retain the hardware-verified
  Xbox Series `045E:0B13` contract. Gecko Automatic uses `045E:02E0` with the
  same stick/trigger ordering, hat-only D-pad, and standard B0–B16 mapping.
  Firefox's native remapper does not expose Xbox Share as B17. The explicit
  `apple-gamecontroller` profile always remains `045E:0B13`.
- Earlier Xbox One Bluetooth `045E:02FD` spoof experiments reported no usable
  SDL HIDAPI input and are gone from selectable identities; unknown persisted
  identity strings sanitize to `automatic` on load.
- ASTRO C40 `9886:0024` is not a spoof target. It is a DualShock-style
  third-party pad; SDL HIDAPI's Xbox 360 driver special-cases it, but OJD does
  not impersonate it.
- No virtual HID VID/PID universally supplies Windows XInput/GIP semantics on
  macOS. Consumer identity, descriptor, transport, and report behavior must
  be tested separately.

ASTRO C40 PS4 mode `9886:0025` is research-only: it is a possible third-party
DS4-family candidate, not an implemented spoof. Official DS4/DS5 identities
remain preferred when their exact protocol tuples are proven.
